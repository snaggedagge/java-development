# Hottub

## Info
I built a hottub (Vildmarksbad) which is fully controlled by this application. 
I built everything myself from scratch basically, from wooden constructions, plastic interior, heating furnace, piping and programming

Pictures of the entire project can be found on my [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/snaggedagge/media_set?set=a.10156695824828112&type=3)

### Features
* Temperatures are fully configurable from application
* It has built in software based hourmeters, separate ones for oil burner, circulation pump and effective bath time
* It has built in functionality for setting timer, so you can choose if you want to turn it on or off by timer by
selecting temperatures which should take effect on a specific time
* Some lazy log reading functionality, just in case everything goes to hell.
* It circulates regularly for 20 seconds on set intervals to ensure nothing freezes in the piping during cold winters.

## Technical details
It's eqiupped with an Oilburner, Circulation pump,
temperaturesensors for both heater and return water temperature.

I've got three relays controlling this Hottub, one for oilburner, 
one for circulation pump and one for the lights which are located underneath the water.

 
###  Realworld result
Some modifications has been made since this picture, like proper exhaust and a really sporty spoiler to put dry things away on.
