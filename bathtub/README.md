# Hottub

## Info
I built a hottub (Vildmarksbad) which is fully controlled by this application. 
I built everything myself from scratch basically, from wooden constructions, plastic interior, heating furnace, piping and programming

Pictures of the entire project can be found on my [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/snaggedagge/media_set?set=a.10156695824828112&type=3)

### Features
* Temperatures are fully configurable from application
* It has built in software based hourmeters, separate ones for oil burner, circulation pump and effective bath time
* It has built in functionality for setting timer, so you can choose if you want to turn it on or off by timer by
selecting temperatures which should take effect on a specific time
* Some lazy log reading functionality, just in case everything goes to hell.
* It circulates regularly for 20 seconds on set intervals to ensure nothing freezes in the piping during cold winters.

## Technical details
It's equipped with an Oilburner, Circulation pump,
two temperaturesensors for both heater and return water temperature.

I've got three relays controlling this Hottub, one for oilburner, 
one for circulation pump and one for the lights which are located underneath the water.

It is 50mm isolation all around so it drops only about 6 - 10 degrees in 24 hours

* If can take about 1900 L of water (about 1600L used for ~6 people) 
* Room for 8 - 10 people
* Heats up in about 1600L water in 3 hours from approximately 6 - 10 degrees to 37
 
###  Realworld result
Some modifications has been made since this picture, like proper exhaust and a really sporty spoiler to put dry things away on.
