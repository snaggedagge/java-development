# Hottub

I built a Hottub which is equipped with an Oilburner, Circulation pump,
temperaturesensor for both heater and return water temperature.

I've got three relays controlling this Hottub, one for oilburner, 
one for circulation pump and one for the lights which are located underneath the water.
