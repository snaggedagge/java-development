# All my essential Java based systems

# Notes:

* This is for the moment pretty much a backup for me, if i
get more serious in the future i will create more appropriate submodules

* This is also a highly experimental library, a few things is very badly written on purpose, 
so they would get finished quickly.

* A few things might be extremely over engineered and complicated,
 this is probably because I was trying some things out and haven't yet got the time
 to decide on what is best.
